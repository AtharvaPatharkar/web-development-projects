# 🧮 Welcome 🖐 to the Wordle Clone

This project is a clone of the popular Wordle game. The goal is to guess a hidden 5-letter word in 6 attempts, with color feedback for each guess. Green indicates the correct letter and position, yellow indicates the correct letter but wrong position, and gray means the letter isn't in the word.
